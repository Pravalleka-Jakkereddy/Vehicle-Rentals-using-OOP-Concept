# Vehicle-Rentals-using-OOP-Concept
This is a console-based Vehicle Rental Application developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The application allows only one user to register and log in, rent vehicles, and proceed to payment.

The project is built without any frontend or database. All functionality is handled using Java classes and runtime memory.
