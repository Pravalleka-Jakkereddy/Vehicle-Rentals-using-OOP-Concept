Vehicle-Rentals-using-OOP-Concept

A console-based Vehicle Rental Application developed in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application allows a single user to register, log in, rent vehicles, and complete payment.

The project does not use any frontend or database; all operations are handled through Java classes and runtime memory. To enhance the console experience, colored text and blinking messages are used for better readability and user interaction.

This project demonstrates effective use of core OOP concepts in a simple, terminal-based application.
