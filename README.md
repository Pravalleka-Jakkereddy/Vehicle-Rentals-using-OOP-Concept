Vehicle-Rentals-using-OOP-Concept

A console-based Vehicle Rental Application developed in Java, designed to demonstrate strong implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application supports a single user workflow including registration, authentication, vehicle rental, payment processing, and invoice generation, all handled entirely through Java classes and in-memory execution without the use of a frontend interface or database.

To enhance the terminal-based user experience, the system incorporates colored and blinking console messages along with animated ASCII visuals, such as a moving car animation displayed in the command prompt. Upon successful payment, the application generates and presents a structured invoice directly in the console.

This project highlights effective use of core Java, OOP design, and creative console-based UI techniques within a lightweight, terminal-driven application
